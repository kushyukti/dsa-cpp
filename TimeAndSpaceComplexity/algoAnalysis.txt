We evaluate the performance of an algo in terms of input size 

1. Time Compelexity- Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size

2. Space Complexity - Amount of memory taken by an algo to run , as a function of input size


How to represent Complexity?
Asymptotic Notation - Mathematical tools to represent time and space Complexity

1. Big-Oh Notation (O-Notation) - Worst Case Compelexity

2. Omega Notation - Best Case Compelexity

3. Theta Notation - Average Case Compelexity


Note:
1. Multiple Algorithms exist for the same problem and there is no one right solution.different algorithms work well under different constraines.

2. The same algrithm with the same programming language can be implemented in different
ways.

3. When writing programs at work, don't lose sight of the big picture, Rather than writing clever code, write code that is simple to reand and maintaine.
